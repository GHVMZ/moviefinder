# Moviefinder
Movie Finder is a project created by a group of student at the University of Gothenburg in the Software Engineering and Management program.
In the first term of the program everyone got an assigment to create a decision support system (DSS) as a project and we chose to create this website called Movie Finder where users can search a database and find different kinds of movies.
